React is a JavaScript library built for creating user interfaces on any platform (web page, mobile device, terminal application, etc.). It is based on UI componentization: the interface is divided into independent components that contain their own state. When a component's state changes, React re-renders the interface. This makes React a very useful tool for building complex interfaces, as it allows the interface to be divided into smaller, reusable pieces.

It was created in 2011 by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook who wanted to simplify the way complex user interfaces are created.

React is declarative and helps us create interactive user interfaces easily, based on components. It is a universal library, meaning React can run both on the client and the server. This allows our application to reuse the same code, instead of having separate code for the server and the client, making it easier to write our application just once.

What are the main features of React?

Components: React is based on UI componentization. The interface is divided into independent components that contain their own state. When a component's state changes, React re-renders the interface.

Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to render components. The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM. When a component's state changes, React re-renders the interface. Instead of modifying the real DOM, React modifies the virtual DOM and then compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM. This way, React knows which changes to apply to the real DOM.

Declarative: React is declarative, which means that it specifies what should be done, not how it should be done. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

Unidirectional: React is unidirectional, meaning data flows in one direction. Data flows from parent components to child components.

Universal: React can run both on the client and the server. Additionally, you can use React Native to create native applications for Android and iOS.
