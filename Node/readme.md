Objective: Understand the importance of using Node.js, what it is, and why it is necessary for creating applications, APIs, and services.


Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server. It is a powerful tool for building fast and scalable server applications.


It is open-source, cross-platform (meaning it works on various platforms), asynchronous, and has an event-driven architecture for input and output operations.


When it is said that Node.js is event-driven, it means that the system is designed to respond to various "signals" or "events" occurring within the application. This programming model allows Node.js to handle multiple operations efficiently without blocking the main process.


Node.js and Google Chrome share the same execution engine, which is the V8 engine. V8 is a high-performance JavaScript engine developed by Google for the Chrome browser. It was designed to compile JavaScript code to native machine code, thereby improving execution speed and efficiency.
